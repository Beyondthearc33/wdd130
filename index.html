     Hello, My name is Luke Lucas. I am from Lehi, Utah. I currently work as a Software Engineer in Test for a Healthcare Company.
     My current hobbies are Crypto, Drones and Basketball. I would like to expand on each of my hobbies and tell you why they are so great.<br> <br>
     
     Starting with Crypto, during the pandemic I built my first pc. It started to gather dust so I decided to start mining crypto so that I was atleast getting something out of it. Crypto has its ups and down and maybe one day the crypto Ive mined will be worth something.<br> <br>

     My wife and I run a photography business on the side. We love capturing moments when we can. My favorite part of our business is anything that lets me fly one of my 4 drones.<br> <br>

     Basketball has been a huge part of my life since High School. I was never good enough to play high school ball but I would help manage the team. I got really into the analytics of the game, so after going on a mission to Seattle Washington, I now cant wait for the Supersonics to come back to there.
